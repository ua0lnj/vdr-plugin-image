Required:
-----------
- fullfeatured dvb card
- vdr 1.5.8+
- plugin depends follow packages
    + ffmpeg (tested with ffmpeg-0.4.8/ffmpeg-0.4.9pre1/ffmpeg-cvs)
        http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net
    + for build you need 'pkg-config'
        http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/
    + libexif-0.6.13 ... 0.6.15 (see below for build without this)
        http://libexif.sourceforge.net/
    + for running your will need also package netpbm
        http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/
        netpbm 10.0+ (check for "anytopnm", if  it does not exist upgrade/install netpbm)
    + not necessary but useful utils/file (file) for better imagetyp detection, 
        this tools is used by script anytopnm
        ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/file

Important Note:
if tools are installed by source absolutely also for it provide that the 
programs (anytopnm pnmscale pnmfile pnmcut pnmflip) are inside the search-path, 
otherwise adapt the variable "PATH"  within the file imageplugin.sh.

Install:
------------
Install the plugin part as usual (see vdr docs if you not know already).
You will need a full source tree from vdr, to build this plugins.
copy source to below defined folder.

    cd $VDRSOURCE/PLUGINS/src
    tar -xzvf vdr-image-x.x.x.tgz
    ln -s image-x.x.x image

Compile depends package ffmpeg, libexif. later for running your 
need netpbm for image conversion.

 build ffmpeg
    $ configure --enable-shared && make && make install

 build libexif 
    $ configure && make && make install

 now compile plugin

    $ cd $VDRSOURCE
    $ make plugins

 or if you need, defined a ffmpeg source folder ¹) 
 this essential if build ffmpeg without "--enable-shared"

    $ make plugins FFMDIR=/usr/src/ffmpeg-cvs

 compile without swscaler to convert images via ffmpeg
   (WITHOUT_SWSCALER=1 use img_convert, needed for older versions from ffmpeg)
    
    $ make plugins WITHOUT_SWSCALER=1

 compile without libexif ¹)
    
    $ make plugins WITHOUT_LIBEXIF=1

 to install plugin

    $ make plugins-install


¹) Build options can also defined inside $VDRSOURCE/Make.config



In the ./examples directory you can find a sample file for
imagesources.conf, change this file if needed and place it in
the plugins folder in your config folder (the video folder by default).

The syntax is :
<path>;<name in vdr menu>;<0/1>;<pattern to filter file display>

examples:
/media/cdrom;CDROM;1;*.jpg *.jpeg *.png *.tif* *.bmp
/archive/photos/holiday;Holiday pictures;0;DSC10*.jpg

0/1 is for media that need to be mounted (uses the same mount.sh
as mplayer/mp3 plugin).


The file ./scripts/imageplugin.sh could go to /usr/bin, or any other folder in your path.
You can also use the plugin options (vdr -help after installing the plugin) to specify
the path's to the files, if you don't want to those files in you system.
[ e.g.: ./vdr '-Pimage -C /usr/local/bin/imageplugin.sh -m /usr/local/bin/mount.sh' ...]

All plugin options :

  -m CMD,   --mount=CMD    use CMD to mount/unmount/eject image sources
                           (default: "mount.sh")
  -C CMD,   --convert=CMD  use CMD when converting images
                           (default: "imageplugin.sh")
  -c PATH,  --config=PATH  to specify directory of configuration data
                           relative to VDR Plugin configuration directory
                           (default: "" )

image commands
------------
The file imagecmds.conf can be used to define commands that can be applied to the 
currently viewed image. The syntax is exactly the same as described for the 
file commands.conf, see "man 5 vdr". If only one instruction is indicated, 
the filename of the image will be appended to the command string, 
separated by a blank and enclosed in single quotes.

Format> Menutext ?: command %s
?  - Confirmation request (optionally)
%s - placeholder for filename (optionally)

See for a sample at examples/imagecmds.conf .


Diagnosis of the scripts and installation
-----------------------------------------
If the script does not work like it should, start the Script to test from the console.

imageplugin.sh [infile] [outfile] [WIDTH] [HEIGHT] [ZOOMFACTOR] [LEFTPOS] [TOPPOS] {FLIPCMD}
e.g. imageplugin.sh myimage.png outfile.pnm 720 576 0 0 0 original

and please examine the produced syslog messages at /var/log/message or messages on console

if that does not help repeats the procedure with > export DEBUG=yes;

export DEBUG=yes;imageplugin.sh myimage.png outfile.pnm 720 576 0 0 0 original

and examine the expenditure on the screendump

*) if script work for your, it's could reduce the message on syslog, 
if your change on imageplugin.sh inside from VERBOSE=yes to VERBOSE=no
